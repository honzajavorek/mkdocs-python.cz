# python.cz

Czech Python community homepage on MkDocs.

## Status

See the website at [honzajavorek.github.io/mkdocs-python.cz](https://honzajavorek.github.io/mkdocs-python.cz/).
This is a proof of concept and a work in progress.

## Goals

-   Give up on complicated custom solutions which have little added value, but enormous overhead
-   Give up on custom design, because there is nobody in the community to maintain custom designs
-   Use as much existing software as possible
-   Make the website easy to maintain, easy to edit, easy to contribute

Intentionally not trying to achieve feature parity with existing python.cz website.

## TODO

-   ~~port static content~~
-   ~~customize the theme~~
-   ~~events as a plugin~~
-   ~~fix absolute links and make them relative~~
-   ~~icons~~ (index is here: https://emojipedia.org/twitter)
-   ~~images~~
-   ~~legacy redirects~~
-   ~~analytics~~
-   ~~english version~~
-   ~~delete the old code~~
-   keep tests which make sense and delete the rest
-   nice to have: social cards - https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-social-cards/
-   nice to have: logo should be on a white circle
